# GetPythonBookPractice

This is practice from the book *Get Programming: Learn to Code With Python* (Ana Bell)

Code is organised into directories, most of which (i.e. the numbered ones) represent chapters from the book. 
The "Misc" directory contains "just for fun" code which is unrelated to the book.

This project's repository also includes a couple of quite pointless commits which have been done in pursuance of learning and better understanding git.
